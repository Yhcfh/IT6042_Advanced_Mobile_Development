## About the Course

IT6042 Advanced Mobile Development explores the design, implementation, and deployment of mobile applications using modern frameworks and tools. The repository includes sample code, assignments, and projects demonstrating concepts such as:

- Cross-platform development
- Native vs. hybrid approaches
- User interface and user experience (UI/UX) design
- Mobile databases and data persistence
- Networking and API integration
- Security and best practices

## Technologies Used

This repository leverages the following technologies:

- **React Native (Expo):** For fast, cross-platform mobile app development.
- **Node.js:** For backend services, API integration, and development tooling.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript:** Main programming languages for both client and server.
- **Other Tools:** (Add any other relevant tools or libraries, e.g., Firebase, SQLite, REST APIs, etc.)
